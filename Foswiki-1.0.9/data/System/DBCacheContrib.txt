Reusable code that caches Foswiki topics, and provides fast
searches of the content.

%TOC%

---++ Summary of Contents

This module supports fast structured queries over topics in an
arbitrarily-sized web. It uses a database to cache topic data to
deliver much more scaleable search performance. Different back-end
techologies can be used to implement the cache, to allow simple
tradeoffs between scaling and raw performance.

Historically this module was designed to be used with a
companion plugin, such as Foswiki:Extensions.FormQueryPlugin or
Foswiki:Extensions.DBCachePlugin, which support queries and the display of
query results. When used this way, the %TOPIC% supports queries made using
a simple [[%TOPIC%#QueryLanguage][query language]].

The module can also be used in "standard schema mode" to support plugins
that accelerate core functions, such as the !QueryAcceleratorPlugin.

---++ Features
   * Perform efficient structured queries on data in forms

---++ Using the built-in query language
The query language supported by !DBCacheContrib is very similar to the query language used with %SEARCH, which was derived from it. The contrib can be used in two modes; compatible schema mode (as used by FormQueryPlugin and DBCachePlugin) and standard schema mode (as described in QuerySearch).

In standard schema mode the schema of the DB is as described in QuerySearch.
In compatible schema mode, the underlying schema is somewhat different, to
support the extended requirements of the plugins that use it.

---+++ The Compatible Schema
You can think of the database as an map of all the topics in a web. Each
entry is itself a map (or hash, in perl terms) that maps a set of field
names to values.

Each topic in the web automatically gets a number of standard fields, generated
by reading the metadata from the topic (see %SYSTEMWEB%.MetaData)
	* =name=        - name of the topic
	* =parent=      - *name* of parent topic
	* =_up=         - _reference_ to the Map of the parent topic, if it exists
	* =attachments= - array of Maps, each of which contains:
		* =_up= - _reference_ to the Map for the topic
		* =name= - attachment name
		* =attr= - e.g hidden
		* =comment= - attachment comment
		* =path= - client path used to upload attachment
		* =size= - size in Kb
		* =user= - who uploaded the attachment
		* =version= - e.g. 1.3
	* =info= - Map containing:
		* =_up= - reference to the Map for the topic
		* =author= - most recent author
		* =date= - date of last change
		* =format= - topic format version
		* =version= - topic version number
	* =moved= - Map containing:
		* =_up= - reference to the Map for the topic
		* =by= - who moved it
		* =date= - when they moved it
		* =from= - where they moved it from
		* =to= - where they moved it to
	* =form= - form type
	*  _form name_ - e.g. if a "My<nop>Form" is attached, this will be
          =My<nop>Form=. This is a reference to a Map containing a key for each
          field in the form. Each key maps to the value in the form data for
          that key. The Map will also have an =_up= reference to the Map for
          the topic.
	* =text= - raw text of the topic)

The sub-maps created for =info=, _form name_, =moved=, and each row in
=attachments= also have a _reference_ back to the topic Map, called  =_up=.

Other fields may be added by subclasses. Refer to the documentation for the
plugin that is using the DBCache for more details.

---++ Query operators
%STARTSECTION{"searchoperators"}%
Fields are given by name, and values by strings or numbers. Strings should always be surrounded by 'single-quotes'. Strings which are regular expressions (RHS of <nop>=, !<nop>= <nop>=~ operators) use 'perl' regular expression syntax (google for =perlre= for help). Numbers can be signed integers or decimals. Single quotes in values may be escaped using backslash (\).

The following operators are available:
| *Operator* | *Result* | *Meaning* |
| <code>=</code> | Boolean | LHS exactly matches the regular expression on the RHS. The expression must match the whole string. |
| <code>!=</code> | Boolean | Inverse of = |
| <code>=~</code> | Boolean | LHS contains RHS i.e. the RHS is found somewhere in the field value. |
| <code>&lt;</code> | Boolean | Numeric < |
| <code>&gt;</code> | Boolean | Numeric > |
| <code>&gt;=</code> | Boolean | Numeric >= |
| <code>&lt;=</code> | Boolean | Numeric <= |
| =lc= | String | Unary lower case |
| =uc= | String | Unary UPPER CASE |
| =IS_DATE= | Boolean | Compare two dates e.g. '1 Apr 2003' IS_DATE '1 Apr 2004' |
| =EARLIER_THAN= | Boolean | Date is earlier than the given date |
| =EARLIER_THAN_OR_ON= | Boolean | Date is earlier than, or on, the given date |
| =LATER_THAN= | Boolean | LHS is later than the given date |
| =LATER_THAN_OR_ON= | Boolean | LHS is later than the given date |
| =WITHIN_DAYS= | Boolean | Date (which must be in the future) is within n _working_ days of todays date |
| <code>!</code> | Boolean | Unary NOT |
| =AND= | Boolean | AND |
| =OR= | Boolean | OR |
| <code>()</code> | any | Bracketed subexpression |

Dates for the date operators (=IS_DATE=, =EARLIER_THAN= etc) must be dates in the format expected by =Time::ParseDate= (like the [[Foswiki:Extensions/ActionTrackerPlugin][ActionTrackerPlugin]]). =WITHIN_DAYS= works out the number of _working_ days assuming a 5 day week (i.e. excluding Saturday and Sunday). Apologies in advance if your weekend is offset &plusmn; a day! Integers will automatically be converted to dates, by assuming they represent a number of seconds since midnight GMT on 1st January 1970. You can also use the =d2n= operator to convert a date string to such an integer.

---++ The cache
To achieve best perfomance the plugin caches the data read from topics in a
database. The database is stored in the work area for the DBCacheContrib (see
={WorkAreaDir}= in =configure=). If any topic changes in the web, this
cache is automatically rebuilt (subject to configuration options). The cache
can be deleted at any point with no ill effects.

---++ Detailed Documentation
Clients use the DBCache by defining a subclass of the
=Foswiki::Contrib::DBCacheContrib= class. Implementors are stongly recommended to read the POD documentation in the code:

<!--
	* Set SHORTDESCRIPTION = Reusable code that treats forms as if they were table rows in a database
-->

---++ Installation Instructions
You do not need to install anything in the browser to use this extension. The following instructions are for the administrator who installs the extension on the server.

Open configure, and open the "Extensions" section. Use "Find More Extensions" to get a list of available extensions. Select "Install".

If you have any problems, or if the extension isn't available in =configure=, then you can still install manually from the command-line. See http://foswiki.org/Support/ManuallyInstallingExtensions for more help.
