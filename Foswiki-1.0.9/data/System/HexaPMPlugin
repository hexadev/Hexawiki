---+ Empty Plugin

This Plugin does nothing.

This is an empty Plugin topic you can use as a template for your own Plugin
documentation topic.

Learn how to create your own plugin in %SYSTEMWEB%.DevelopingPlugins.

---++ Plugin Preferences

Settings specific to your plugin can be stored as [[%SYSTEMWEB%.PreferenceSettings][preference settings]]. Default values for these preferences can be set in plugin topics; for example:
   * One line description, used by other tools:
      * Set SHORTDESCRIPTION = Empty Plugin used as a template for new Plugins
This is then referenced using ==%<nop>EMPTYPLUGIN_SHORTDESCRIPTION%==.

If you want to redefine a preference setting, for example in %USERSWEB%.SitePreferences, or in a web preferences or in your personal preferences, you must define the 'long form' e.g.
      * <nop>Set EMPTYPLUGIN_MYPREFERENCE = my preference

---++ Installation
You do not need to install anything in the browser to use this extension. The following instructions are for the administrator who installs the extension on the server.

Open configure, and open the "Extensions" section. Use "Find More Extensions" to get a list of available extensions. Select "Install".

If you have any problems, or if the extension isn't available in =configure=, then you can still install manually from the command-line. See http://foswiki.org/Support/ManuallyInstallingExtensions for more help.
