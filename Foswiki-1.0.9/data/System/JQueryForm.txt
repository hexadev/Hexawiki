The jQuery Form Plugin allows you to easily and unobtrusively upgrade HTML
forms to use AJAX. The main methods, ajaxForm and ajaxSubmit, gather
information from the form element to determine how to manage the submit
process. Both of these methods support numerous options which allows you to
have full control over how the data is submitted. Submitting a form with AJAX
doesn't get any easier than this!
