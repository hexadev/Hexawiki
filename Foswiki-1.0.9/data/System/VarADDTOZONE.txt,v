<verbatim class="tml">

</verbatim>

   * zone: optional, comma-separated list of zones the content should be added to,
     special zones are =body= and =head=, defaults to =head=
   * tag: optional, identificator for the material to be added, to be used in =requires=
   * requires: comma-separated list of tags that must occur before the current material, constraints the order of all material in a zone
   * text: optional, text to be added to the named zone, mutually exclusive with =topic=
   * topic: optional, full qualified web-topic name that contains the text to be added, mutually exclusive with =text=
   * section: optional, section of the =topic= to be added, defaults to the default section between STARTINCLUDE and
     STOPINCLUDE

Note, that using =topic= and =section= is actually a short form of 
<verbatim class="tml">
%ADDTOZONE{
   "myzone"
   text="$percntINCLUDE{\"topic\" section=\"section\" warn=\"off\"}$percnt"
}%
