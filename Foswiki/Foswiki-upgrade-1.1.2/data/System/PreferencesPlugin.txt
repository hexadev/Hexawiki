%META:TOPICPARENT{name="Plugins"}%
---+!! <nop>%TOPIC%

Allows editing of preferences using fields predefined in a %SYSTEMWEB%.DataForms. However, the edit fields are inlined in the text, similar to how tables are edited in Foswiki:Extensions/EditTablePlugin.

%TOC%

Insert the =%<nop>EDITPREFERENCES%= preference (see below) anywhere in your topic. It will be replaced by a button that allows editing each preference in its predefined input format (or a text box, when no format is defined for this preference).

In edit mode, the edit button is replaced by Save and Cancel buttons, with their obvious meanings.

---++ Syntax Rules

   * =%<nop>EDITPREFERENCES{ "topic" }%=
      * _topic_ references a [[%SYSTEMWEB%.DataForms][DataForm]] defining the format of the edit fields for preferences. It may be prefixed by a web.
      * If a [[%SYSTEMWEB%.PreferenceSettings][preference setting]] is not mentioned in the form referenced by _topic_, a text input box of the specified length is provided.
      * Otherwise, the input can be through textareas, select, radio, checkbox, date, or text, as provided by %SYSTEMWEB%.DataForms.
   * =%<nop>EDITPREFERENCES%=
      * Edit existing preferences in the topic using a simple text field.
---++ Examples
   * =%<nop>EDITPREFERENCES%= 
   * =%<nop>EDITPREFERENCES{ "%<nop>SYSTEMWEB%.DefaultPreferencesForm" }%= 

<!--
   * Set SHORTDESCRIPTION = Allows editing of preferences using fields predefined in a form

|  Release: | 20 Sep 2009 |
|  Change History: | <!-- versions below in reverse order -->&nbsp; |
|  20 Sep 2009: | Small documentation update. Code tidied up. No preferences in plugin topic. No other functional changes. |
|  19 Apr 2009: | Ignore all saving unless it happened by saving a form using POST method. |
|  15 Dec 2008: | Arthur Clemens added reading of =Local= preferences. Foswiki version |
|  05 Nov 2007: | Kenneth Lavrsen fixed problem when settings are hidden in html comments. These settings are now ignored. |

|  08 Feb 2007: | Arthur Clemens added access keys for Save and Cancel, bold style for editable preference names, and a descriptive Save button label. |
|  15 Apr 2006: | Adding css classes to buttons. Removed debug print statement causing 500s on !SunOne. Prevent extra space in settings on saves. Switched to earlier handler. Converted all SCRIPTURL to SCRIPTURLPATH, and added support. The only SCRIPTURLs should be the one in the BASE tag and those in mail notification templates. Because the forms package was throwing an exception when it failed to create a form, the edit preferences plugin was aborting the whole of the session whenever the form specified in EDITPREFERENCES didn't exist. Changed it so that the Form constructor does not throw, but returns undef on a non-existant form, and changed preferences plugin to be tolerant of missing forms (ie defaults all fields to text if the form is missing, of is a Set exists which is not in the form). | 
|  26 May 2005: | Crawford Currie recoded to use code from Form.pm to render form fields. |
