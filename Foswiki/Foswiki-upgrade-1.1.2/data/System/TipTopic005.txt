---+ Re-parenting a topic

The breadcrumbs ([[Contribs]] &gt; [[TipsContrib]] &gt; [[TipsOfTheDay]], for example) of any topic is constructed automatically in Foswiki by following the set topic parent. In the footer of a topic viewed with the default PatternSkin is a *More topic actions* link which will allow you to select a new parent for the page.

To re-parent a page:
To re-parent a topic: 
   1 Click *More topic actions* on the topic you wish to re-parent
   1 Navigate to *Set new topic parent*
   1 Click *Pick from a list*
   1 Select a new parent from the list
   1 Click on the *Set new parent* button

You will notice that the breadcrumb will now reflect the new parent.
