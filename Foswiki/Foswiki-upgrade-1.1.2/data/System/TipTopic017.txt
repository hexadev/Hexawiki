---+ Revision control

In Foswiki, assuming appropriate AccessControls, anyone can change anything but those changes are logged.  There is a complete audit trail with record of:
   * Version
   * Date of last revision
   * Person who made change
The default PatternSkin offers access to previous versions using the *History* link in the footer of any viewed topic. Differences between revisions can also be reviewed by clicking on the ==&gt;== symbols located between the revision numbers depicting the versions available.
