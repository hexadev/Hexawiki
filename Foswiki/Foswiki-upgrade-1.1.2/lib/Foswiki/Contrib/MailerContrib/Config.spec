# **REGEX**
# Define the regular expression that an email address entered in WebNotify
# must match to be identified as a legal email by the notifier. You can use
# this expression to - for example - filter email addresses on your company
# domain, or even block use of raw emails in WebNotify altogether (just make
# it something that will never match, e.g. <code>^notAnEmail$</code>).
# If this is not defined, then the default setting of
# <code>[A-Za-z0-9.+-_]+\@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+</code> is used.
