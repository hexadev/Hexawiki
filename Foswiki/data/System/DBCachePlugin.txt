---++ Description
This is a lightweight frontend to the DBCacheContrib. The provided
macros DBQUERY and DBCALL can be used as a replacement for SEARCH and INCLUDE
that use the database store instead of searching and extracting on the raw
topic files. 

*DBQUERY* is provided to ease the use of
<nop>WikiApplications based on the DBCacheContrib combining its flexible query
language with unrestricted formatting and an extend mechanism to extract topic
properties. 

*DBCALL* is named "call" and not "include" as its main purpose is to ease 
<nop>WikiApplications where <nop>TopicFunctions are treated as stored procedures.
It fetches pre-compiled topics or sections of it. "Glue" chars
(see Foswiki:Extensions:GluePlugin) are applied in advance so that the actual rendering time
is minimized. DBCALL does therefore not allow to call "external" pages as INCLUDE allows.
DBCALL's "warn" parameter can only be set to "on" and "off" and does not allow 
alternative content in case of a warning. The "pattern" feature used to extract a fragment from
an INCLUDEd text using regular expression  has been dropped.
That aside, DBCALLs can be called recursively as INCLUDEs can,
parametrized using key-value arguments and
obeys to %<nop>STARTINCLUDE%, %<nop>STOPINCLUDE%, %<nop>STARTSECTION{"..."}% 
and %<nop>ENDSECTION{"..."}%.

Using the <nop>DBCacheContrib topic sections are stored into the topic object of the database.
The section between %<nop>STARTINCLUDE% ... %<nop>STOPINCLUDE% is called 
=_sectiondefault= whereas all sections between %<nop>STARTSECTION{"&lt;name>"}% .... 
%<nop>ENDSECTION{"&lt;name>"}% are called =_section&lt;name>= and are stored accordingly.

In addition, DBCALL implements so called *TopicMethods*. A method call is of the
form =%<nop>DBCALL{"SomeTopic->RenderMethod" ...}%= and will infer the actual
=...RenderMethod= to be called on the base of the _TopicType_ of =SomeTopic=. !TopicTypes
are a concept introduced by the Foswiki:Extensions.WorkbenchAddOn. It basically refers
to a convention to tag the type(s) of a topic in a formfield "TopicType". The lookup
mechanism for !TopicMethods proceeds as normal if the DBCALl is not of the form
="SomeTopic->RenderMethod"=. For example, if =SomeTopic= is of type =Video, <nop>MediaType, <nop>ClassifiedTopic=
the lookup mechanism will try to find the methods =VideoRenderMethod=, =MediaTypeRenderMethod=
and =ClassifiedTopicRenderMethod= in the given order and use the one found first. The web
these types are defined in is inferred on the base of the !DataForm definitions of each of 
these types. If none of these type-specific methods is found the method call will fallback
to a normal non-specific function call. The !TopicMethod itself is called with an implicit
parameter =OBJECT= that refers to =SomeTopic=, that is the object this method has been called for.

*ATTACHMENTS* lists the attachments of a given topic giving you a high degree of control about
what and how to display attachments. 

*DBRECURSE* iterates over topics in a web following a certain topic-to-topic relation, like
the parent-child relation among topics. You can define arbitrary relations using filters.


---++ Syntax
---+++ ATTACHMENTS
List all attachments of a given topic. Without any parameters it displays a
table of attachments similar to the one generated by the templates at the bottom
of a topic. There are a couple of parameters that take regular expressions to
limit the number of attachments to be listed.

*Syntax:*
| *%<nop>ATTACHMENTS%, %<nop>ATTACHMENTS{"&lt;topic>" ...}* ||
| ="&lt;topic>"= | topic whos attachments we want to query | 
| =attr="..."= | match the attachments' attribute |
| =autoattached="yes,no,undef"= | limit attachments to those that are (not) autoattached |
| =comment="..."= | match the attachments' comment |
| =maxdate="..."= | specify latest attachment |
| =maxsize="..."= | specify biggest attachment |
| =mindate="..."= | specify earliest attachment |
| =minsize="..."= | specify smallest attachment |
| =names="..."= | match the name of attachments to be include in the list |
| =user="..."= | match the attachments' user who uploaded it |
| =footer="..."= | format string appended to the result |
| =format="..."= | how to format each attachment |
| =header="..."= | format string prefixing the resulting output |
| =separator="..."= | format string put between each formatted attachment  |
| =hidenull="on,off"= | hide/display the empty result; only the header and the footer are included \
                if set to "off" and there's no attachment at the given topic |
| =sort="name,date,size,user,comment,comment:name"= | sort results by specified field |
| =reverse="on/off"= | enable reverse sorting |
| =limit="..."= | limit the number of attachments to the given number; by default show all |

The following variables can be used in the format parameter:
   * $attr: the attributes
   * $autoattached: the autoattach flag
   * $comment: the comment field
   * $date(&lt;format>): the attachment date using &lt;format> to format the date
   * $date: the attachment date
   * $delete: the action to delete the current attachment
   * $deleteUrl: the url used in the delete action
   * $icon: img tag representing the filetype
   * $iconUrl: the url pointing to the icon used in the img tag
   * $index: the position index of the attachment in the result
   * $move: the action to move the current attachment
   * $moveUrl: the url used in the move action
   * $name: the name of the attachment
   * $path: the path property of the attachment
   * $props: the action to change the properties of the current attachment
   * $propsUrl: the url used in the props action
   * $size: the size in bytes 
   * $sizeK: the size in kilo bytes 
   * $sizeM: the size in mega bytes 
   * $topic: the name of the topic of whose attachments are listed
   * $type: the file type of the current attachment
   * $url: the attachments url
   * $urlpath: the attachments urlpath
   * $user: the user that uploaded the attachment
   * $web: the web name of the current topic
   * $webdav: the action to edit the current attachment using the Foswiki:Extensions/WebDavPlugin
   * $webdavUrl: the url used in the webdav action
   * $wikiuser: the user's home topic that recently changed the current attachment

The header and footer format strings may only contain
   * $count: the number of attachments found

The format, header and footer may contain the standard escape sequences:
   * $dollar: $ sign
   * $n: newline
   * $percnt: % sign
Example:
<verbatim>%ATTACHMENTS{format="| $name: | $type |"}%</verbatim>
generates:
%ATTACHMENTS{format="| $name: | $type |"}%

---+++ DBCALL
Fetch topic content or a section of it from the database store.

*Syntax:*
| *%<nop>DBCALL{"&lt;topic" ... }%* ||
| ="&lt;topic>"= | topic that we'd like to call |
| =section="..."= | optional named section; without this parameter the "default" section is used |
| =&lt;key>="&lt;value>"= | topic arguments to be substituted within the included text; that is \
            every occurrence of &lt;key> is substituted with &lt;value> |
| =warn="on,off"= | enable/suppress error warnings |
| =remote="on,off"= | switch fixing !WikiWords in transcluded content; \
                     =on= means "don't touch, this is remote content" \
		     defaults to "off" because that's the default behaviour of \
		     =%<nop>INCLUDE{}%= (note, DBQUERY defaults to "on" \
		     aka do-not-touch-mode) |

---+++ DBDUMP
Display the database record of a topic (useful for debugging).

*Syntax:*
| *%<nop>DBDUMP{"&lt;topic>" ... }%* ||
| ="&lt;topic>"= | topic that we'd like to debug |
| =web="..."= | name of the web to look for the given topic; \
  note that you can use the dot-notation in specifying the <nop>web.topic also |

---+++ DBQUERY
DBQUERY can be used in either of two modes (a) as a pure search
tool or (b) as a tool to extract properties of (a set of) known topics.

*Syntax:*
| *%<nop>DBQUERY{"&lt;search>" ... }%* ||
| ="&lt;search>"= \
| search clause, see below |
| =topics="..."= or =topic="..."= \
| set of topics to consult (mode (b)); \
  if "topics" are specified in addition to a "search" it will be restricted to \
  the given topics |
| =web="..."= | web where to search for hits; defaults to the current one |
| =format="..."= | format string to display search hits;\
  defaults to "$topic"; the special format string "none" disables the format string |
| =header="..."= | format string to prepended to the list of hits |
| =footer="..."= | format string to appended to the list of hits |
| =separator="..."= | format string used to separate hits; \
  defaults to "$n"; the special separator "none" disables separation |
| =include="..."= | pattern each found topic name must match to be considered a hit |
| =exclude="..."= | pattern each found topic name must not match to be considered a hit |
| =sort="..."= | specifies the sorting of hits; defaults to "name" |
| =reverse="..."= | specify if hits should be sorted in reverse order; defaults to "off" |
| =limit="..."= | maximum number of topics to include in the hit set |
| =skip="..."= | number of topics to skip while constructing the hit set; defaults to "0" |
| =hidenull="..."= | flag to indicate that an empty hit set should not be displayed |
| =remote="on,off"= | switch fixing !WikiWords in transcluded content; \
                     =on= means "don't touch, this is remote content" \
		     defaults to "on" |

Following variables are expanded in format strings:
   * $percnt: % sign
   * $dollar: $ sign
   * $n: newline
   * $nop: "empty string"
   * $count: the number of hits
   * $index: the current row index in the search
   * $web: the web where the hits where found
   * $formfield(&lt;formfield-name>): the value of the given formfield
   * $formatTime(&lt;formfield-accessor> [,&lt;format>]): format the datefield pointed
     to by the &lt;formfield-accessor> using the given &lt;format>; the format can be
     in any form supported by =Foswiki::Func::formatTime()= 
     (see [[%SYSTEMWEB%.Macros#DISPLAYTIME_format_formatted_dis][Macros]] documentation).
   * $expand(&lt;formfield-accessor>): return the formfield pointed to by the 
      &lt;formfield-accessor>
   * $rss(...): encode entities so that the text can be included in an rss feed
   * $encode(...): encode entities so that the text can be included in HTML input form elements
   * $flatten(...): remove any special markup producing a flattened text representation
   * $trunc(...,length): truncate a string to the given length
   * $d2n(...): converts a date string to epoch seconds
   * $uc(...): converts a string to upper case
   * $lc(...): converts a string to lower case

*Formfield accessors:*

In its most basic form =$expand(Ref)= is identical to =$formfield(Ref)=. In addition
=$expand()= can be used to refer to topic properties of related topics that can be reached from the current one using the '@' symbol. For example, if a topic A uses a form that contains a field named "Ref" and specifies a reference to 
another topic B (by using its name) you can access the "Headline" in B from A using =$expand(@Ref.Headline)=.

A formfield accessor can be a composed one using 'or' and 'and'. Example: =$expand(Name or Author)=
will expand to the value of the formfield "Name" if it exists and is non-empty and to the value 
of the formfield "Author" otherwise. More valid examples:
   * =$expand(@Ref.Headline)=: headline of the referred topic
   * =$expand(Nr and '.')=: append a dot to the formfield value "Nr" if it exists
   * =$expand(Name or Author)=: expand to "Name" or "Author"

A formfield accessor can be computed using <nop>TopicMarkup. If the string starts with '%',
it is expanded and its result is taken as the real formfield accessor. This is useful when the 
name of the formfield must be computed by different means.

---+++ DBRECURSE
Traverse topic-to-topic relations, like the intrinsic parent-child relation

*Syntax:*
| *%<nop>DBRECURSE{"&lt;topic>" ...}%* ||
| =&lt;topic>= | starting point, can be in web.topic format, defaults to the current topic |
| =web="..."= | web where to recurse, defaults to the web given in the =topic= parameter or the current web |
| =format="..."= | format string for each found topic defaults to ='   $indent* [<nop>[$web.$topic][$topic]]'= |
| =single="..."= | format string used when only one topic is found, defaults to value of =format= parameter |
| =separator="..."= | separator string to be put between formatted topics, defaults to ='\n'= |
| =header="..."= | format string to be prepended to the output, empty by default |
| =subheader="..."= | format string to be prepended to each subordinated search, defaults to =header= parameter |
| =singleheader="..."= | format string to be used when only one topic is found |
| =footer="..."= | format string to be appended to the output |
| =subfooter="..."= | format string to be appended to each subordinated search, defaults to =footer= parameter |
| =singlefooter="..."= | format string to be used when only one topic is found |
| =hidenull="..."= | flag to indicate that an empty hit set should not be displayed |
| =filter="..."= | search expression that is used in each recursion step; \
                   the current topic name is inserted into the filter expression by replacing the ='$ref'= string; \
                   the default filter is ='parent='$name'=; this will search for topics of which the current topic \
                   is a parent |
| =sort="..."= | determines the sorting order of topics in each iteration step |
| =reverse="on,off"= | reverse sorting order |
| =limit="..."= | maximum iterations, default is =0= (unlimited) |
| =skip="..."= | skips the first =n= hits when formatting the output, defaults to =0= (no skip) |
| =depth="..."= | only recurse to a given depth, defaults to =0= (unlimited) |
| =include="..."= | regular expression topics must match to be included in the search |
| =exclude="..."= | regular expression that excludes matching topics from the search |

The =...format=, =...header= and =...footer= format strings may contain the following variables:
   * $web: the current web
   * $topic: the current topic in the search
   * $index: the topic index number in one recursion step, that is an enumeration in each recursion step
   * $number: the "paragraph" number in the recursion, e.g. =1.2.1.5= depicts the path alternative in the recursion tree
   * $count: number of found topics; this is the total number of found topics in the =header= and =footer= and the
             number of topics _found so far_ during recursion
   * $indent: 3 spaces per depth
   * $indent(&lt;string>): uses =&lt;string>= for indenting the result in each depth
   * $formfield(...): see #DBQUERY
   * $expand(...): see #DBQUERY
   * $formatTime(...): see #DBQUERY

All format strings may contain the following variables:
   * $dollar: $ sign
   * $n: newline
   * $percnt: % sign

Example:

<verbatim>%DBRECURSE{"%SYSTEMWEB%.FrequentlyAskedQuestions"}%</verbatim>
 lists all %SYSTEMWEB%.FrequentlyAskedQuestions topics (with properly set topic parent):
%DBRECURSE{"%SYSTEMWEB%.FrequentlyAskedQuestions"}%


---+++ DBSTATS
Compute and format a statistics on the database.

*Syntax:*
| *%<nop>DBSTATS{"&lt;search>" ...}%* ||
| ="&lt;search>"= | query string that defines a search, see DBCacheContrib |
| =web="..."= | the web where to search in (default: current web) |
| =field(s)="..."= | name of one or more formfields to be extracted (default: "text") |
| =split="..."= | regex split up a field value into a list before matching each item against =pattern= |
| =pattern="..."= | regex pattern to extract keys from the formfield(s); \
                    note, that before the pattern is applied the field value is split up using the =split= parameter; \
                    you must provide at least one grouping ("(...)") in the pattern string that \
		    encloses the key to be extracted (default: "^(.*)$"); \
		    you may have up to five groupings in one pattern that are \
		    accessible each in the format string |
| =header="..."= | header format string to be prepended to the output |
| =format="..."= | format string used for each key in the output |
| =sep(arator)="..."= | separator to put between formatted keys |
| =footer="..."= | footer format string to be appended to the output |
| =sort="alpha,created"= | order of keys in the output |
| =reverse="on,off"= | sort keys descending or ascending |
| =limit="..."= | maximum number of keys to be formatted in the output |
| =hidenull="..."= | flag to indicate that an empty hit set should not be displayed |

The DBSTATS searches for all topics in given web and reads the given form fields.
It then uses the =split= and =pattern= parameters to extract all keys in the data counting their occurrences.
The result is rendered using the =format= parameter for each token found, separating them
by =sep=, prepend the =header= and append the =footer=. Results can be sorted alphabetically
or by createdate.

Format strings (=header=, =format=, =footer=) can use the following variables to insert
the computed statistics:
   * $key, $key1: the found key, this must match the first group in the pattern argument
   * $key2, $key3, $key4,$key5: second, third, etc grouping in the =pattern= argument
   * $count: the number of occurrences of the key
   * $index: index of the key within the sorted result set
   * $min: minimum count found in the search
   * $max: maximum count found in the search
   * $sum: sum of all counts
   * $mean: mean occurrence of a key in the result set
   * $keys: total number of keys found
   * $web: the web we search in
   * $topics: the list of all topics where the keys where found

For example if you want to extract all month/years from a database's =Date= field
that has the format =dd mon yyyy= and then format a link to an archive using
the month and the year as separate url parameters then use something like this:
<verbatim>
%DBSTATS{"<db query>"
   field="Date"
   pattern="((\w+) (\d\d\d\d))"
   header="---++ Archive"
   format="   * <a href="...?month=$key2&year=$key3">$key</a>"
}%
</verbatim>

Note, that the above pattern will crop away the day. Groups can be nested counting
them from left to right, outside to inside:  the first group matches the
compete pattern, the second the month the third the year.

---+++ TOPICTITLE
derive the title of a topic from a couple of properties:

*Syntax:*
| *%<nop>TOPICTITLE{"&lt;topic>"}%* ||
| =&lt;topic>= | topic we want the page title off, defaults to current topic |

   * from a TOPICTITLE preference variable, or
   * from a "TopicTitle" formfield attribute, or
   * defaults to the topic name

---++ Syntax of search queries
A search query is a boolean expression on fields of a topic. (Tip: use %DBDUMP to explore the available fields).

%INCLUDE{"DBCacheContrib" section="searchoperators"}%

---+++ Examples
   * Find all topics that have been last modified before 1st January 2008
     <verbatim>%DBQUERY{"info.date EARLIER_THAN '1st January 2008'"}%</verbatim>
   * Find all topics last modified by Peter
     <verbatim>%DBQUERY{"info.author =~ 'Peter'"}%</verbatim>
   * Find all FAQs
     <verbatim>%DBQUERY{"topic =~ 'FAQ'"}%</verbatim>
   * Find all topics that have the word "random" in it (case-insensitive) excluding the current topic
     <verbatim>%DBQUERY{"lc(text) =~ 'random' and topic != 'DBCachePlugin'"}%</verbatim>

---++ Perl API

The <nop>DBCachePlugin supports overloading the contained default database cache by inheriting
from =DBCachePlugin::WebDB= being itself a =DBCacheContrib=. The only purpose of the 
=DBCachePlugin::WebDB= is to extract the <nop>TopicFunctions contained in a topic as described
above. You can easily extend this functionality by deriving a <nop>WebDB specific to your
own <nop>WikiApplication. For example, the Foswiki:Extensions.BlogPlugin defines a <no>WebDB of
its own where it caches the createdate of a topic being either specified in a formfield  or
given in the timestamp of the first revision of a topic.

---+++ <nop>DBCachePlugin 
---++++ getDB()
Returns a database object used for further queries.  This function must be
called ahead of any actual database access. If your <nop>WikiApplication is
using a derived <nop>WebDB then use the =WEBDB= variable in your WebPreferences
to point to its implementation (example: =Set WEBDB =
Foswiki::Plugins::BlogPlugin::WebDB=). If =WEBDB= is not defined the default
implementation =Foswiki::Plugins::DBCachePlugin::WebDB= is used.  Note, that this
way only one application-specific database cache can be loaded _per web_.  This
is rather a design decision; otherwise each DBQUERY and DBCALL tag would have to
declare which database it operated on. So currently the rule of thumb is: one
web one <nop>WikiApplication making use of this plugin.

returns a database object. See the Foswiki:Extensions::DBCacheContrib documentation
for its interfaces.

---+++ <nop>DBCachePlugin::WebDB 
This implements the database object that is used to access the topic records in
a web. Note, that for each web there is exactly one <nop>WebDB database object.
A database object is fetched (and initialized if needed) by the
<nop>DBCachePlugin::getDB() function. 

---++++ dbQuery()
The DBQUERY functionality can be access from within perl using the plugins =dbQuery()= method.

| *(@$topicNames, %$topicObjs, $errorMsg) = $db-&gt;dbQuery([$search, @$topics, $order, $reverse, $include, $exclude])* ||
| =webDB= | database object |
| =search= | search clause |
| =topics= | restrict search to this list of topics |
| =order= | define a sorting on the hit set; this can be any formfield accessor or \
  one of the shortcuts "created" (for createdate) or "modified" (for info.date) provided  \
  for compatibility with default %SEARCH |
| =reverse=on,off= | revert the sorting order |
| =include= | pattern that topic names must match to be considered a hit |
| =exclude= | pattern that topic names must _not_ match to be considered a hit |

returns a list pointer of all found topics names, a hash pointer to an array of all found
topic objects (keys are the name of the topics) and a possibly defined error message.

---++++ getFormField()
Access the formfield value of an arbitrary topic.

| *$value = $db-&gt;getFormField($topic, $formfield)* ||
| =topic= | a topic name |
| =formfield= | a formfield name |

returns the value of the named formfield 

<!-- %RED%TODO: document the rest of the methods %ENDCOLOR% -->

---++ Plugin Settings
See also DBCacheContrib for additional configuration settings.

Each web can specify an alternative implementation inheriting from <nop>DBCachePlugin::WebDB.
To specify it you have to set the =WEBDB= variable in the WebPreferences. The default is =Foswiki::Plugins::DBCachePlugin::WebDB=
   
---+++ <nop>MemoryCache
If =$Foswiki::cfg{DBCache}{MemoryCache}= is set to FALSE (defaults to TRUE)
the dbcache once loaded into memory will stay there among multiple requests.
This option only has an effect using speedy/perperl or fastcgi setups.

---++ Plugin Installation Instructions
You do not need to install anything in the browser to use this extension. The following instructions are for the administrator who installs the extension on the server.

Open configure, and open the "Extensions" section. Use "Find More Extensions" to get a list of available extensions. Select "Install".

If you have any problems, or if the extension isn't available in =configure=, then you can still install manually from the command-line. See http://foswiki.org/Support/ManuallyInstallingExtensions for more help.
