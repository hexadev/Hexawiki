---+ !CompareRevisionsAddOn Plugin

This is an helper plugin for the CompareRevisionsAddOn on Foswiki

It has two purposes:
   1 It sets the =CompareRevisionAddonPluginEnabled= flag, which can be used by templates (e.g. used by the HistoryPlugin)
   1 It provides an easy way to replace links to the original =rdiff= script by links to the new =compare= script.

---++ Syntax Rules
   
=%<nop>RDIFF2COMPARE{"text"}%= - Replaces links to the =rdiff= script with links to the =compare= script

---++ Plugin Settings

(none)

---++ Plugin Installation Instructions 

This plugin is installed together with the CompareRevisionsAddOn, see the instructions there.
It should be enabled (if necessary) with the configure script.

Test: <nop>CompareRevisionsAddOnPlugin is %IF{"context CompareRevisionsAddOnPluginEnabled" then="" else="*not* "}%installed and enabled.

|  09 Aug 2009 | Plugin is now a default plugin shipped with Foswiki. It will later have its function integrated in core in a future Foswiki version so its life as default plugin is temporary. Changed its switchboard setting to EXPERT so it is hidden in configure. You should never need to change this anyway. |
