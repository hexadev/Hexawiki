Learn how to create your own plugin in %SYSTEMWEB%.DevelopingPlugins.

---++ Plugin Preferences

Plugin preferences should be set using =configure=, as described in
%SYSTEMWEB%.DevelopingPlugins. You can also use
[[%SYSTEMWEB%.PreferenceSettings][preference settings]] to define any
user-controllable configuration. You are strongly advised
to use the name of the plugin as a prefix, to avoid the risk of namespace
clashes with other extensions that may try to use the same name.

---++ Installation
You do not need to install anything in the browser to use this extension. The following instructions are for the administrator who installs the extension on the server.

Open configure, and open the "Extensions" section. Use "Find More Extensions" to get a list of available extensions. Select "Install".

If you have any problems, or if the extension isn't available in =configure=, then you can still install manually from the command-line. See http://foswiki.org/Support/ManuallyInstallingExtensions for more help.
