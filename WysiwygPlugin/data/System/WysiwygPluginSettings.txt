---+ Settings for WysiwygPlugin that are common to most editor integrations
%STARTINCLUDE%
---++++ WYSIWYG_EXCLUDE - Prevent WYSIWYG editing 
%X% This is not supported currently by the !TinyMCE Editor.  This setting is not used.

The *global* [[%SYSTEMWEB%.PreferenceSettings][preference setting]] =WYSIWYG_EXCLUDE= can be set to make the plugin sensitive to what is in a topic, before allowing it to be edited. You can set it up to veto an edit if the topic contains:
   * =html= - HTML tags (e.g. =&lt;div&gt;=, not including &lt;br&gt;), or 
   * =macros= - simple macros (e.g. =%<nop>VAR%=) or 
   * =calls= - macros with parameters e.g. =%<nop>MACRO{...}%=
   * =pre= blocks (=&lt;pre&gt;=)
   * HTML =comments= (=&lt;!--= ... =--&gt;=)
If the plugin detects an excluded construct in the topic, it will refuse to allow the edit and will redirect to the default editor.
---+++++ WYSIWYG_EDITABLE_CALLS - Exceptions to WYSIWYG_EXCLUDE
If you excluded =calls= in =WYSIWYG_EXCLUDE=, you can still define a subset of macros that do *not* block edits. this is done in the *global* [[%SYSTEMWEB%.PreferenceSettings][preference setting]] =WYSIWYG_EDITABLE_CALLS=, which should be a list of macro names separated by vertical bars, with no spaces, e.g: =* Set WYSIWYG_EDITABLE_CALLS = COMMENT|CALENDAR|INCLUDE=

You should set =WYSIWYG_EXCLUDE= and =WYSIWYG_EDITABLE_CALLS= in %USERSWEB%.SitePreferences, or in %WEBPREFSTOPIC% for each web.
---++++ WYSIWYGPLUGIN_STICKYBITS - Protext tags based upon their arguments
You can define the global preference =WYSIWYGPLUGIN_STICKYBITS= to stop the
plugin from ever trying to convert specific HTML tags into
TML when certain specific attributes are present on the tag. This is most
useful when you have styling or alignment information in tags that must be
preserved.

This [[%SYSTEMWEB%.PreferenceSettings][preference setting]] is used to tell the translator which attributes, when present
on a tag, make it "stick" i.e. block conversion back to TML. <blockquote>For example, setting it to
=table=background,lang;tr=valign= will stop the translator from trying to
convert any =table= tag that has =background= or =lang= attributes, and any
=tr= tag that has a =valign= attribute back to Foswiki =| table | column |=
markup.</blockquote>

This setting is used only after the page has been processed by the editor.  If
the editor does not support a particular tag or attribute and the editor corrupts the
tag, this setting will not be helpful.  It is only used to prevent
an HTML tag from being converted back to TML.

Format of the setting is =tag1=attrib,attrib;tag2=attrib=.  Attributes delimited by
comma, and tags delimited by semicolon.
   * The left side of the equal sign is the tag. 
   * The right side of the equal sign is a comma delimited list of attributes to be matched.  
If a matching tag is found, that matches any of the attributes listed,
the tag will not be converted back to TML.
You can use perl regular expressions to match tag and attribute names, so
=.*=id,on.*= will ensure that any tag with an id or =on*= event handler is kept as
HTML.   

The default setting for this preference are hard coded in the plugin.  If you
wish to change the settings, the following list is the default setting coded
in the plugin:
<verbatim>
   * Set WYSIWYGPLUGIN_STICKYBITS = .*=id,lang,title,dir,on.*;
    A=accesskey,coords,shape,target;
    BDO=dir;
    BR=clear;
    COL=char,charoff,span,valign,width;
    COLGROUP=align,char,charoff,span,valign,width;
    DIR=compact;
    DIV=align,style;
    DL=compact;
    FONT=size,face;
    H[0-9]=align;
    HR=align,noshade,size,width;
    LEGEND=accesskey,align;
    LI=value;
    OL=compact,start,type;
    P=align;
    PARAM=name,type,value,valuetype;
    PRE=width;
    Q=cite;
    TABLE=align,bgcolor,frame,rules,summary,width;
    TBODY=align,char,charoff,valign;
    TD=abbr,align,axis,bgcolor,char,charoff,headers,height,nowrap,rowspan,scope,valign,width;
    TFOOT=align,char,charoff,valign;
    TH=abbr,align,axis,bgcolor,char,charoff,height,nowrap,rowspan,scope,valign,width,headers;
    THEAD=align,char,charoff,valign;
    TR=bgcolor,char,charoff,valign;
    UL=compact,type
</verbatim>

If you edit using the plain-text editor, you can use the &lt;sticky&gt;..&lt;/sticky&gt; tags to delimit HTML (or TML) that you do *not* want to be WYSIWYG edited.
